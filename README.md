# Rotten-Tomato-Score-Predictor

This project aims to predict Rotten Tomatoes critic scores using sentiment analysis on YouTube movie trailer comments. This predictive model can help assess audience and critic reactions before the movie's release, even ahead of official critic reviews, providing valuable insights for filmmakers, marketers, and analysts.
