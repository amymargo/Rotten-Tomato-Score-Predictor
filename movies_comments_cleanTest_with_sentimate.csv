My comment will be a bit long because of how this film touched me. Emotionally I just can39t put it into a few words....brbrBrendan39s amazing proformance was riveting and the superb writing of this script is not to be downplayed, even by the slightest bit. This story is a  masterpiece of emotional truth that we find ourselves becoming a part of as we allow this fragile and forever endearing character to become a part of us.brbrThe Whale is full of hope. It is also  filled with a character drowning in his own vast ocean of sorrow and regret. Somehow Brendan39s character keeps his small hope floating while we the watchers find ourselves participating emotionally, as we too struggle to swim there in that vastness with him.brbrFinally we experience the evidence that his hope has bloomed into his own loving miracle. His daughter, broken in the good way of forgiveness stands before him as he struggles to take those last final steps that go way beyond proving his love for her. brbrWe experience this amazing moment of reward between them as we watch with held breath.. we become part of their redemption and understanding. We, the audience get to be a part of those profound final moments of love that are utterly captivating and gut wrenching in the most positive way.brbrThis film eloquently shows the human need to be seen. To be understood. To be loved and forgiven by those around us, and yes, even by ourselves.brbrBrendan39s performance pulls us willingly into the lows of loneliness and loss as we yeild to his emotional pain. He has this uncanny ability to make us believe his character is real on every level. So much that we find ourselves lost in his portrayal as it resonates with us on a personal level. brbrThe emotional depth, the severe physicality and sadness of the characters decision to just give up combined with his ability to still cling to his undying hope for others is irresistible.brbrHis character, ultimately cuts through the boundaries to expose the fears that we all share. The fear that our fellow humans will only see us through their physical eyes, blind to who we truly are, the person we are inside. And lastly his character exposes our core reason for life...our complete need to be loved and accepted while feeling we are important enough to be worthy of that love.brbrThis film touched my heart... it will touch the heart and soul of anyone who has struggled with their own demons. His character will resonate with individuals that have been in that dark place, that place of giving up. The place that seems to be the only option to escape the vast emptiness they are drowning in.brbrBrendan39s performance drew me in and kept my hanging there. I understood him. I clung to his hope as if it were my own. I wanted to comfort his pain and yet at the same time, I wanted to slap him for giving up.brbrI felt angry about his lack of effort to survive and fight for life. I admittedly also felt a profound empathy pouring from my heart simultaneously. I was crying. I literally felt his need for redemption and love from his unwilling angry daughter. brbrI wanted her to stop being blinded by her self pity. I wanted her to see that everything sacrificed in his life was done for her, because she was what mattered to him. She mattered more than his own life and that he had more than proved it.brbrI know it sounds stupid but I yelled at her there on my TV screen.... brquotCan39t you see his regret. You39re everything to him. Stop being such a brat.. look at him!  See him! Why can39t  you see you are the very last piece of his will to live!quot...brbrThen I used the F bomb. I felt invested and needed that last word to emphasize it.

There are many references to Moby Dick in the film and a certain poembrthat Charlie reads to himself quotI felt the saddest of all the boring chaptersquot which were only descriptions of whales because I knew that the author was only trying to save us from his sad story with just this even if only for a short time. In the end we will understand why this poem is so important to Charlie since it is directly attributedbrto his relationship with his daughter who is angry with him. I don39t remember when I saw a film whose director was so aware of the psychophysical connectionbrAnd my soul, because we all feel with Charlie every little discomfort and the film is a mask of agony. Despite this, the poor light blue color of Charlie39s soul shines a certain lightbrForgiveness, mercy and the huge heart of a whale, in a certain sense Charlie is the whale from Moby Dick and his daughter is only Ahab insteadbrAhab is mentally broken or you can say that Ahab is his past sins. All of the director39s films were horrible to watch and genius in equal measure except Noah which I didn39t likebrHis ability to combine religion, people who fall into the horrors of humanity, the search for redemption and perfection, the illusions of the mind arebrThey are so precise in making the audience feel what is happening on the screen that I won39t be disappointed even if he really knows the secret of the philosophicalartistic connection between body and soul. In Whale this is even more noticeable because the film is theatrical and filmed almost entirely in a small, gray apartment like Charlie39s life. A young missionary A real boy who claims he was sent by God to save him from his death and exchange his gluttony for the soul the missionary belongs to a crazy and stupid Christian sectbrwho believes in the end of the world and the return of Jesus and all this nonsense and this is where the Jewishreligious element enters the film in the subtextbrAnd also Anorofsky39s successful attempt to introduce real spiritual content into the film. The film is based on a play, so it looks theatrical every moment of Charlie39s eating himself to death, towards the end he tries to get back in touch with his evil daughterbrAllegedly and promises to pay her with spending time with him, of course she really hates the whole world and him in particular, he tries to buy her and promises to help her write articlesbrBy the way, Charlie is a writing teacher for the school through the InternetbrHe lies to his students that his camera is broken out of shame. Ryan Fraser is perfect for the role and you can see that he brings a lot of his hard life to the role and slowly the feelings of disgustbrthat the audience feels towards him turn to pity and then to compassion. HerebrAnorofsky reminds us all of what true spiritual meaning isbrWithout any philosophies or religion, the egoless Charlie absorbs insults and swallows them all with his huge whale heart. He loves his daughter Eli more than anything and continues to grant her forgiveness, love without conditions and absolute honesty even when she wishes him dead. Many times the door of the gray apartment opens and golden and white light Went inside. By a strange coincidence I remember reading Moby Dick at least parts of itbrThere was a Panamanian monologue by one of the figures who said something like I wonder why the golden light associated with the deity is sobrdoes not exist in nature. I39m not sure about this paragraph completelybrBut it seems to me that Anorofsky created something amazing out of this. The end of the film is one of the most meaningful. Charlie is dying and asks Eli to read him the poem I spoke about at the beginning. With this even just for a short time. The final scene is a collapsing soul from a heartbeat, the tears will rise in your throat, the pain will be sad and severebrFinally we find out that Ellie wrote this poem in the 8th grade, Charlie tells her this poem and Darren Anorofsky will surpass himself with another masterpiece and teach us all what spirituality really is or at least what it is supposed to bebrAnd maybe just for a short time we will all forget about the boring, small and nervous lives of some of us just with this even for a short time.

I think the biggest problem was the fans hyping it up to be some kind of ensemble of cameos and expecting to be bigger than what it was when they never really advertised it as such. I mean they were never gonna do a whole Avengers-Level Multiverse threat in this movie. Alls the film did was lay groundwork for what will become DoomsdaySecret Wars.,Doctor strane doctor ,It was Lilia All Along !!!!!!,Wong still hits with that straaaaange,Badass movie,Hearing this theme and thinking of the quote from MoM Things just got out of hand is bone-chilling,Trailers that are FAR WAY BETTER than the movies,If only Wanda had known that her children were still alivereincarnated in her own universe.

It would go so hard, especially the frozen lake scene for those who dont know, its original concept art for this movie when the story was different Nightmare was the villain and he had a horse.

I was so much hyped for this,"After watching the movie then coming back to this trailer, I honestly would39ve preferred that due to the events of No Way Home, and with Strange opening the multiverse it was starting to cause the destruction of Earth-616. And it39s up to Wanda and Strange to fix it while facing powerful enemies and a dark version of Doctor Strange. While also having America Chavez help them along the way, and while they39re traveling through other dimensions Wanda sees happier versions of herself, like her brother being alive, or she and Vision lived together happily and of course one with her children. And from there at the end it39s teased that even though she saved their universe she starts to have her villain arc. That way it alludes to Wanda Vision but for people who didn39t watch it would have a vague understanding of what39s going on and if they want to find out more they can go watch it themselves.brbrBecause at the end of the Wanda Vision it39s alluded that Wanda was still somewhat quotgoodquot but she unlocked something terrible that would eventually corrupt her.

There was also another brother whos death was by suicide that wasnt shown. Apparently it was said that the film could not withstand another brothers death but that sounds like a cop out. These events were important and their stories matter. They all deserved more. Its a truly tragic family curse. I loved how we got to see the Mother start painting again.

With the many conflicts that arise throughout the musical, it is hard not to relate to the rejection, failure, grief, discrimination and sacrifice Usnavi, Vanessa and Nina faced. brAs a Mexican American first generation college student, I can strongly relate to Ninas  fear of disappointing her father as he constantly sacrifices every penny to put her through college. With having to face similar circumstances, Nina, played by Leslie Grace, symbolizes a small glimpse of hope for the long and overwhelming journey that comes with pursuing a higher level education for immigrants and dreamers.brFinally, I would love to give a round of applause for the diversity and depth given to these characters. I especially am proud to see a strong Latinx characters going through hardship, failing and rising up against all odds.

The ending was tragic but it was based on real life.brbrHere39s to Miles and Shelby. ,,this was 4 years ago and i never even heard of it..... o0 weird.,"This was an awful movie, and largely fictionalized. brbrFor starters, it gets the whole quotDavid v Goliathquot aspect of the story backwards- in reality, Ferrari was the quotDavidquot and Ford was the quotGoliathquot. At that time, Ferrari was a struggling little family business on the brink of bankruptcy, and Ford was one of the richest international mega-corporations in the world. brbrSecond, this was a BRITISH victory, not an American victory- Ford paid Roy Lunn British to find a British team, which was renamed quotFord Advanced Vehiclesquot, and was based in Surry England. The quotFord GT40quot was in reality the British Lola Mk6, designed and built by Eric Broadley British. That39s why the steering wheel is on the right side. They renamed it the quotFord GT40quot, because Ford was writing the checks to fund the team. Driver Ken Miles was British.

Saw them all, loved them all. They all make me happy and they all make me sad. So does reading the original stage script by Arthur Laurents.",Without a doubt Steven Spielberg39s greatest work.......,It39s been exposed that celebs slaves are fake personas not real people professional liars and their lives are scripted debased demonic lonely and they live by no rules and multiple CIA doppelganger agents and secret androgynes can play the same fake persona at the same time or switched out at different times and given another fake persona to play. They can be another ethnicity or nationality than the one they portray themselves to be and have an expiration date. They are brand names only and under MK Ultra undetectable mind control Monarch Butterfly programming and hypnosis suffering everyday from DID alters triggered by handlers to perform whatever tasks their owners the satanic elite wants them to do to promote their satanic agendas and narratives. Their compartmentalized fragmented mind has amnesia walls built in to forget their core personality so they don39t know who they truly are and actually are insane and forget about ungodly deeds performed behind the scenes. They are chosen from satanic cult family bloodlines and related to each other and to the Royal family and most of the original prototypes celebs slaves are discarded and replaced by the age of 18. The satanic elite determines the net worth of each celeb slave who are not rich but given a black card with an allowance of no more than 1 million dollars. They don39t write their own material but given material written in witch language to send out secret messages in double or triple intenders. Relationships are arranged not love matches can be between celeb and their handlermanager and children are produced at the satanic elite39s breeding facilities by means of breeders surrogates IVF twinning adoption and stolen children and used as props to make up the fake families especially for secret inverted couplespeople. They worship Satan and sacrifice to the GOAT shaped demon the Baphomet the so called divine androgyne. The satanic elite hides the truth in plain sight in movies TV shows award shows docs interviews social media sites books magazines pictures song lyrics and music videos etc.br80 of social media influencers are CIA agents can be doppleganger agents with multiple accounts and fake personas.,i like it,imdb-rating7.210,The movie wouldve been a bigger hit had Spielberg not opened his mouth with that ridiculous Giving English power over Spanish statement for not subtitling his movie.,Kinda like me.

All looks good. ,People always romanticize this relationship and never talk about the grooming involved.,"Oh no , If Elvis was alive he could tell more about truth , if Priscilla got manipulated by him , why is she still copy Elvis Presleys favourite style brShe has to be thankful he changed all her life  style brI dont believe what she says always",Deci? ,This is Priscilla39s side of the story.

This woman was the most senseless, cruel, heartless and biggest mistake of Elvis Presley. If he hadn39t married this evil woman, the money-grubbing old woman, he would never have suffered this fate.. ..this stupid woman destroyed the life of a legendary star....she gives these stupid words so that they can make a video for her and tell her that the whole world knows this woman is the murderer of Elvis Presley.",Great Movie,Ive never seen this yet but its been on my list,I can39t believe how all you people like this movie Priscilla is a fbb liar,That come out the wrong way I39m saying she sucked unbelievable,First of all he sucked second of all she sucking belief mode,I can39t believe how this movie sucked,"I would have love to see Austin Butler as elvis again, i wonder if the casting director were living under the rock",Cailee Spaeny,"This film is what Priscilla wants you to believe, but for Americans like me who actually MONITORED the real life timeline at the time, and backed it up with additional research that we39ve learned since, there is in FACT NO EVIDENCE that Elvis had ANY romantic interest in her before she turned 18.  And in fact he was THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY from her in Vegas or Memphis or Florida. and she was in GERMANY until she became OF AGE. Priscilla39s mother and father were the ACTUAL GROOMERS, but she doesn39t tell THAT REAL STORY. Elvis was not a groomer.","Im sorry but hes just to tall, hes literally a giant for any normal roles",Just wanted to know what Mary the daughter of The godfather Michael Corleone been up to. Glad she is making a name for herself ,Jezebel Wagner,"The film is a strategic coverup for Priscilla39s financial crimes and misrepresentation of Elvis Presleys legacy, and Elvis fans are rightfully particularly upset by her actions in regard to her daughter Lisa Marie Presleys trust and estate.brbrHere are the key pointsbrbr-- Theft from Lisa Marie39s Trust Priscillas unauthorized withdrawal of 16 million from Lisa Marie39s trust without her knowledge or consent is a major violation of trust, both as a mother and a financial custodian.This financial mismanagement has affected Lisa Maries children, who are now without the money that was meant for them, money Elvis Presley had earned and gifted to his child.brbr-- Financial Mismanagement by Priscilla and Associates Priscilla, along with other family members and associates, collectively drained Lisa Maries wealth through failed ventures and selfish motives, allegedly squandering a total of around 100 million. This as a profound betrayal of both Lisa Marie and Elvis39 legacy.brbr-- Priscillas Use of Elvis39 Name Elvis fans are particularly upset by Priscilla39s continued use of the Presley name, despite being divorced from Elvis for 50 years. Her attempt to retain public and financial connections to Elvis through the use of his surname is shameless and disrespectful to Elvis39 memory, especially given the accusations shes made against him.brbr-- Claims Against Elvis Its contradictory and disingenuous that Priscilla, who has benefited greatly from her association with Elvis, is now making serious accusations about his character, such as calling him a serial child molester with no evidence or corroboration. This is not only unfair but also a direct attack on Elvis39 legacy that appears motivated by revenge and lies she previously profited off of in her 1985 book, as is corroborated by her own daughter Lisa Marie in private emails to this pathetic director of this terrible film. brbr-- Burying Next to Elvis The notion that Priscilla wants to be buried next to Elvis, despite their decades-long separation and her alleged defamatory comments about him, further underscores my belief that her actions are motivated by financial and public gain, rather than genuine care or respect. The idea that she would move Elvis parents to achieve this is particularly offensive.brbrPriscillas credibility is in shambles due to her past behavior, and any narrative she puts forward, whether in film, interviews, or legal battles, should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This recent film is a deliberate attempt to rewrite history and distract from her own actions, painting herself as a victim while attacking the legacy of Elvis Presleywho remains widely beloved and respected.brbrFor many fans interested in Elvis39 legacy, I urge people to look more critically at Priscillas actions and motivations, and not take her current narrative at face value. brbrIts important that biographical works, particularly those involving such iconic figures, should strive for accuracy and fairness. This mess of a film does none of that.",Besides the insane age gap this movie was boring af   shes a great actress and I loved her wardrobe changes throughout the movie though.,WAIT SHE MET HIM WHEN SHE WAS 14?????????????? ,This is a 1010. I love movies made from women to women!,"Lisa Marie described her mother39s book and movie as REVENGE for Elvis REMOVING HER FROM HIS WILL entirely right before he died in 1977. She also hints at a mental condition which explains the incapability for her mother to tell the truth or to be accurate about Elvis. brbrPriscilla has flipped so many stories around from her book depending on the interview she is doing. She STOLE MILLIONS and I mean upwards of ONE HUNDRED MILLION, from the LISA MARIE PRESLEY TRUST. Its her CREDIBILITY, the complete LACK of compassion for her daughter, for Elvis. And finally, there is not ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE offered, not even an EYEWITNESS. brbrNOTHING offered to prove that Elvis dated her, touched her, was interested in her, when she was 14, 15, 16, 17. Its just not there. And Elvis is one of the most PHOTOGRAPHED HUMAN BEINGS that ever lived. Nothing shows Elvis as being with her IN ANY FORMAT inappropriately until she was 18.","Priscilla is SUCH A SHADY thief and liar... Currie Grant is the Army soldier that 14 year old Priscilla very chillingly has sex with in order to score secret access to Elvis39s party. brbrCurrie had a four-week affair with Priscilla before arranging the meeting. Naturally Priscilla strenuously denied this. So Priscilla filed a lawsuit against Grant in October 1996 for telling biographer Suzanne Finstad that they had sex, stating in her action that his claims were fabrications. brbrOn August 19, 1998 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Curry found Grant guilty of defamation and ordered him to pay 75,000. Priscilla had sued for at least 10 million.  However, Finstad and the publisher of her book weren39t sued and say they stand by the account in the book.brbrAnd in 2010, author Alanna Nash unearthed a confidential settlement agreement between Grant and Priscilla that puts a different light on the outcome of the court case. On the one hand, it says, Presley can tell the media that she feels quotvindicatedquot by the result of her lawsuit. On the other, Grant will not have to pay a cent in damages provided he never discusses her again in public. brbrFurthermore, while Grant can no longer claim to have had sex with Presley even though he did , she will no longer accuse him of attempted rape and will pay him 15,000 for pictures that he took took when she was a teenager.brbrSO SHE CAN HIDE THE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE THAT PROVES SHE IS A LIAR and willingly sold her body at 14 years of age for a chance to get at Elvis. It proves that it was PRISCILLA who was the Predator, and exposes her 1985 BOOK AND THIS MOVIE WERE BASED ON LIES from MINUTE 1 to the last minute of the book and movie.","Elvis fans39 frustration and passion regarding the portrayal of Elvis Presley and Priscilla Wagner Beaulieu in THIS quotfilmquot is palpable. We clearly feel that Priscilla39s narrative, particularly as presented in Sofia Coppola39s recent film, is deeply flawed and untrustworthy.brbrIts evident that Priscilla39s actions over the years, including financial misconduct and her attempts to control Elvis39 legacy, have severely damaged her credibility. The portrayal of Elvis in the film is a distorted and unfair representation, particularly in light of Priscillas past behavior and motivations.brbrHere are several specific incidents where Priscilla has acted dishonestly or manipulativelybrbr Financial Misconduct The claims that Priscilla misappropriated funds from Lisa Marie39s trust and that she and her associates exploited Elvis39 estate for their own gain and undermine any credibility she might have in recounting her relationship with Elvis.brbr Manipulation and Exploitation Priscillas relationship with Elvis, encouraged by her parents, was more about ambition and status than genuine love. Priscilla and her family manipulated Elvis and have continued to exploit his legacy for personal gain.brbr Challenges to Wills and Estates Priscillas attempts to challenge Elvis39 and Lisa Maries wills suggest a pattern of behavior aimed at securing financial benefits, further casting doubt on her sincerity and integrity.brbr Public Persona and Legacy Priscillas has continued use of the Presley name, AGAINST THE WISHES of Elvis Presley himself as mentioned in his divorce paperwork and will, especially given her illegal and immoral actions and the fact that she divorced Elvis 50 years ago is a real sham. Her court room demand to be buried next to Elvis, replacing his mother39s eternal resting place, is the ultimate hypocrisy.brbrThe bottom line is that Priscilla39s portrayal of Elvis in this quotfilmquot, as well as her overall narrative about their relationship, lacks credibility due to her past actions, questionable motivations, and the absence of supporting evidence. This film misrepresents Elvis and serves more as a vehicle for Priscillas own agenda rather than an honest account of their relationship.brbrFor those who are fans of Elvis or who have studied his life, these are serious accusations that warrant careful consideration. Its important for any biographical portrayal to be grounded in facts and to consider the complexities of all parties involved. I urge young people who haven39t lived in Elvis39 time, to evaluate the motivations behind this portrayal, rather than accepting them at face value.","Movie BUILT ON LIES that she pushed in her 1985 book of lies.brbrPriscillas got the world  thinking Elvis was a groomer and child molester except for one glaring fact she has never provided a single solitary shred of evidence !!!! Nothing.brbrStrange that there are thousands of photographs of them hugging and kissing when they started dating publicly, when she was 18 years of age that she took and the press tookbrbr. YET not one single photo exists that show Elvis touch kiss date or have any kind of relationship before she turned 18. brbrThats because very likely there was no inappropriate behavior from Elvis when she was 14, 15, 16 age of consent in the 60s or 17. THEY WEREN39T EVEN LIVING ON THE SAME CONTINENT for most of those years.brbrElvis very publicly started dating Priscilla when she was 18. It is logistically impossible for ANY of Priscillas accusations in this movie to be true.","The quotPriscillaquot film, has thankfully underperformed at the box office compared to Baz Luhrmann39s quotElvis.quotbrbrBaz Luhrmann39s quotElvisquot indeed had a strong box office performance, grossing over 32 million during its opening weekend and ultimately amassing close to 290 million worldwide. The film was praised for its dynamic storytelling, strong performances, and meticulous attention to the real-life archives and interviews that shaped its narrative. By focusing on Elvis39 life through a vibrant and often sympathetic lens, the film managed to attract both fans and critics alike. It created MILLIONS of NEW YOUNG ELVIS FANS.brbrIn contrast, this quotPriscillaquot film, which seems to delve into more controversial aspects of Elvis and Priscilla39s relationship, is receiving criticism, particularly regarding its portrayal of Elvis as a predator or groomerclaims that MILLIONS of people can see are not substantiated by credible evidence. The film39s focus on Priscilla39s quotperspectivequot has led to skepticism, especially given her past controversies, such as the alleged mishandling of Lisa Marie Presley39s inheritance, stealing millions of dollars from her own daughter, and telling outragioues lies about Elvis thathurt her family and daughter and grandchildren. One committed suicide in fact.brbrIt39s clear that this film has rightly sparked significant debate about its accuracy and the intentions behind its portrayal of Elvis, which fails the sniff test alongside the real life timeline and known facts of the matter.  brbrbrThe stark difference in box office performance between quotPriscillaquot and quotElvisquotproved that audiences were far less receptive to this particular narrative and the film39s marketing failed to generate the same level of excitement as Baz39s Elvis. Its a reminder of how crucial it is for biographical films to balance narrative with factual integrity, especially when dealing with beloved cultural icons like Elvis Presley.brbrThis film FAILED MISERABLY.",,Nice story ,"Austin Butler39s Elvis performance was built for the Oscars, but Jacob Elordi39s was built for realism and people with brains.

Bravo  highly-recommend, and a definite must-watch people! ",    background!    .....,"Reading the books of the New Testament, we probably asked ourselves more than once bquotWhy 2000 years we do not see those miracles that accompanied the hurch of Christ in the I century, as described in the New Testament?quotb Why do the so-called preachers of Christ have to prove that Jesus really existed and atheists boldly deny the historicity or divine origin of Christ? Maybe because the hurch of Christ has not existed for 2000 years?brThe hurch does not exist in the form in which it is presented in the books of the New Testament, but there are Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and other christian sects claiming to be the place of the Church, but they not have the only thing that distinguishes the divine from the human and is characteristic of just the hurch of Christ -the reinforcement of the word with signs, that is, miracles Mark 1615-20. Therefore, some researchers doubt the historicity of Christ, and some of them are not opposed to declaring him a an ordinary philosopher, teacher. But even if Jesus were an ordinary philosopher, his disciples would be ordinary followers of Jesus. And they would not dare to write about the miracles that not only Jesus, but also his disciples, could perform. If there were the Church in our time as described by the authors of the New Testament books, where miracles are performed, the sick are healed, where prophesied, and the dead are raised, no one would doubt the historicity of Christ. Then there would be the same controversy throughout the world as in the first century - Jesus the Son of God or the false prophet who seduces the world by miracles. As a result, we can say that the emergence and development of christian sects and atheism was the result of the fact that over the 2000 years the hurch of Christ did not exist.brbrFind bquotThe Mystery about the Church of Christquotb video on YouTube. The video reveals the prophecy of the disappearance and reappearance of the Church of Christ before the End of the World.

You people never cease to amaze me. You people are the most judgemental nation in the whole entire world. Richard Jewell was a scapegoat and was a suspect only because he was a bit of a recluse, he lived with his mother and was unmarried, so the police investigators assumed that he was angry and an attention seeker, and plotted everything just for attention. I am so sick and tired of you people labelling and suspecting individuals who are totally innocent, but have mental health issues. All I am going to say is that if you are bipolar, aspersers or even an incel the police abroad are going to automatically suspect you even if you are completely innocent. Shame on you people who have all the resources to solve these complicated crimes, but are ignorant. Maybe Richard Jewell should have not alerted the other police that there was a bag under the bench, and let a bloodbath occur.

In the nineties and he was wearing a suit with pants that were too short. Though not everyone could identify this man by name it was suspected he was the one responsible when the bombing occurred. You never heard any of this because the police and media that knew about it chose not to tell. The same media that was sued and had to pay up when they ran articles making Jewell seem guilty.

F U","As a south LouisianaNola native, I can never do movies about my home state. Usually the accents are enough reason, so I appreciate they took a mild approach here Nola accents ARE mild, amp very different from Bayou Cajun, amp Northern Country accents. But no, because Louisiana is a very bdarkb state, despite a fun New Orleans nightlife, amp it39s very hard to relive the deep depression amp traumas that most natives can relate to there. It39s easy for people who can39t relate this feeling to their life to wallow in this kind of deeply bluesy content that embodies the authentic heart of soul of New Orleans, but to us it39s just become a classic romanticization of a black hole most real people can39t escape, as we serve tourists day in amp day out who immerse themselves in the culture for a weekend, talk about how they wish they lived a quirky New Orleans life, amp then get to go back to their normal states that don39t have such a dark, bone-chilling history that can be felt in the air at all times of day amp night. Stories like this will bseemb raw, but they39re just the product of non-native directors romanticizing amp eating up that native pain. We don39t want it sugar-coated, we just want it done right if that39s the direction that they39re balwaysb gonna go in with South Louisiana content. I will say I appreciate that they at least went for an all-southern cast, that39s a commendable choice, but it still doesn39t ensure any more authenticity than otherwise, it just, makes a bit more sense when you consider the complexity of our accents? As good as many actors are at accents, it doesn39t mean much when the dialect coach has no clue what they39re doing, amp they just never do when it comes to Louisiana  Also just to give credit where its due, I appreciated the St Charles shirt. We39re right on the outskirts of the metro so that really felt like an immersive touch. Btw, since when is someone with a traumatic brain injury supposed to be redeployed?? That doesn39t make any sense.",Thats a hard pass,I love how the trailer tells you nothing about what the movie is about.,Nice to see Alfred in this!,Im so excited,So.. what is the film about?,This trailer got me crying and I have absolutely no idea what the movies about,My heart gets warm whenever I hear Alex39s music on other art pieces.,What?,OH IM SO F READY,Beautiful trailer,A24 strikes again  absolutely chilling.

It was some time in 2020 during the BLM protest - and as a young black girl you can imagine how it all felt. Especially being a young black girl who also felt like I had to separate my two identities from the world. If i could watch this movie for the first time again, I would do so without hesitation.

In preparation for a major offensive, British forces placed nineteen large mines filled with explosives beneath German positions. The commanders were so confident these explosions would break the German defenses that they instructed soldiers to advance at a walking pace, not run, across no man39s land. Some units even kicked a football as they moved forward to raise morale and for press coverage. On the first day of the Battle of the Somme, close to 20,000 British soldiers were killed, equivalent to more than six times the number of lives lost on 911. Additionally, around 40,000 were severely wounded. And this was only the first day of the battle.","When the trailer makes you cry, you know the film itself will absolutely kill you.

Terrible Movie!!!!,"5 years old!brbrIt39s only partially a musical but the focus on the true story of this young Pakistani man inspired by Bruce Springsteen39s music is very uplifting brWhen Javid is introduced to Springsteen39s lyrics he truly feels that the lyrics speak directly to him he feels stuck, powerless, and wants to dream on his own. His goal is to become a successful writer even if it goes against his father39s wishes. brHayley Atwell as his teacher is really good in it too.brShe believes he has a knack for his writing to be heard to make a real difference. There39s even a great speech towards the end about how Springsteen grew up like a lot of unfortunate souls whom have had it rough in their upbringing It wasn39t just his American Dream that touched so many fans but many others around the world. Most of us came from nothing, pushed and worked hard endlessly, and had dreams that never came true. But his songs knew how to speak to the ones who wouldn39t let the world knock them down to have what they truly wanted to be happy. It doesn39t matter if you39re Pakistani, English or American everyone has to dream in order to make it real. Is a dream a lie if it doesn39t come true, it39s not a crime to dream, we all want to forget life sometimes and escape, we can build a bridge for our dreams but not walls between our families These are great players here and the music they borrow from Springsteen himself is remarkable.

I saw this preview in theaters, and I didn39t show much interest in it, until now","First saw Bruce in 1978 . Love his music.  It39s sad seeing him over the years fall in with those wanting socialism instead of our republic. He once wrote and sang about truth, but became  your typical  liberal divider where you hate everything all business is evil  rich vs poor narrative.

I remember reading a book about the architecture of the holocaust which described how a victim invested locations with hope or fear as he saw from the attic of his hiding place.

I can39t see how this can be done with film clips by a non-victim 84 years later in a world so totally changed the that the events of 80 years ago can barely be comprehended from a social history perspective never mind the menacing fear of evil, unless it is in the hands of say Andrey Zvyagintsev who made Leviathan the Russian film 2014 which captured the over-bearing injustice of modern Russia without referring directly to it.

You deserve a 5 star ! As my dead mother told me once you need to lose someone to understand how useful and special was this someone for you!

The society is the real monster to be honest. How gross they39re can39t even accept a friendship between same sex these days. Just how the beautiful friendship got broke in this movie tells a lot about it. If I ever have a friendship like this I39ll never let go of that friendship no matter what but the thing is I39ve always been let go from my friends during the toughest and difficult situation of my life tho my story doesn39t match the story in that of the movie but i can totally feel the pain of Remi.

The performances of the two boys is ridiculously good, especially Leo. It39s not a film to enjoy, but it asks some tough questions, particularly about the nature of fragile teenage friendships, its shot beautifully, has some emotionally charged scenes that will leave you in bits.

I was walking my big Alsatian dog,  39bite39 in the park and saw a boy sailing a home made yacht in the huge pond. Also the local Vicar who I knew a bit, was rowing  a hired dinghy. The yacht began to sink. I yelled at Gordon, the Vicar to rescue it, and he did. That was the start of a friendship that lasted from age 8 to 15. At first, Nikka, the boy from down the street, was just a friend, we played together, went roller skating, took trips with both our parents, who accepted us like 2 kids and thought nothing of it. After a while, I sort of half realised that I was in love with him, and he with me. Nothing gay, just plain love and wanting him to be happy. Oh, we did have fun! Neither of us ever wondered about our friendship, we just enjoyed being with each other. We did have other friends, no problem, but when we got to about 14, a nasty boy called us 39queers39. I didnt know what that meant, but Nikka did, and hit the bully on the nose. There was a fight, which I joined in, we were separated by the man who lived next door, as this happened in the street. The bully started spreading rumours about us, and of course we said he was a liar, but people began to think, as we were so close, you know, hard to deny it. The next year was difficult, and eventually his parents decided to go back to Denmark, where they originally came from.  Both Nikka and I were devastated, I didnt know what to do with myself for years following that. We did visit each other a few times, but it wasn39t the same, that beautiful part of my childhood had ended forever. I still think of him a lot, even though I am married with 3 kids, 2 girls and a boy.

Of course there is but that39s not the point! it39s the story behind Mavericks is different! Jay39s life was a incredible and inspiring even though it was cut short. He dared the impossible and chased his dreams. His incredible legacy lives on in all those who knew him and these who surf at Mavericks and Half Moon bay in Santa Cruz California. That is what should be taken from the movie! Not the size of the waves!,The school in the beginning was the high school I went to... Oceana HS in Pacifica ...,"no hoodies. no guns, no fcuk rapping  just a brilliant story",I like the word Mavericks from the movie but today for jay you keep on surfing,"I think it will be great movie for teenagers, I like that kind of scenario about sport.

",What sets Mavericks apart is not the height of the waves but what lies below with shallow rocks and sharks lurking after a wipe-out. It takes guts to surf Mavs and if you have any doubts ask Jeff Clark who surfed it all by himself for 12 years or better yet ask Mark Foo if he was alive about why Mavs is synonymous to surfing brass balls..,"Half Moon Bay, CA thats where it is exactly. I used to live there and go to the competitions in the late fall.
","For all you people who think Mavs is just outside of Hawaii ur fucking stupid.It39s just outside of Half Moon Bay, CA. Its a little South of San Francisco. I would know because I used to live there. The waves are about a quarter mile out. The reason they are so big is because they lie on a cliff, so when the wave breaks there it becomes bigger. Mavs Is known to be larger than Jaws.
